## Wordcloud Application for Our Beloved Mother's
With this notebook, after creating your text regarding your feeling for your mom, you can get rid of stopwords and punctuations (For my case I have chosen Turkish for stopwords.). Then after uploading your mother's image, you should try to detect edges via thresholding and I used image thresholding method as follows in the link.*
Then you can use wordcloud package to process your mother's silhouette into to the words.
